# 🎄 Advent of Code 2025

This repository contains my solutions for **Advent of Code 2025**.

Advent of Code 2025 was a lot of fun, even though the last few days were *crazy hard* for me. Pushed me hard enough that I ended up scrolling through the internet, reading other people’s solutions, and revisiting concepts multiple times. 😅

* Most of the solutions have no comments and explanation as I was quickly writing them, trying to beat the timer 😅. I will slowly polish my codes.
